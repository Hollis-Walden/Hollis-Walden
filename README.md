- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hollis-Walden, a recent graduate and front-end web developer specializing in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- 👀 I’m interested in building accessible websites and applications that people enjoy interacting with!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js and TypeScript
- 💞️ Working on new things with new people is one of the best ways to grow, so I’m looking to collaborate on coding and design projects.
